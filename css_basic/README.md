# CSS Styling Practice

This repository contains practice exercises for CSS styling. It provides a set of HTML files that you can use to practice and experiment with various CSS styling techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open the HTML files in your preferred code editor or web browser.

## Instructions

Each HTML file represents a specific styling exercise. You can open an HTML file and write CSS code to style the elements within it.

To apply your CSS styles to an HTML file, you have two options:

1. Inline CSS: Add inline styles directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
2. External CSS: Create a separate CSS file and link it to the HTML file using the `<link>` element.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different CSS properties, selectors, and techniques to enhance the visual appearance of the HTML elements.

## Examples

To help you get started, here are a few examples of styling exercises you can practice:

1. Changing text color and font family.
2. Adjusting element spacing and margins.
3. Applying background colors or images.
4. Creating hover effects and transitions.
5. Styling borders, shadows, and rounded corners.
6. Using CSS animations and keyframes.
